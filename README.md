My Unit Project for our Java-SQL unit. Overview: A program that takes data in a SQL Table and translates it to a .csv file that can be opened in spreadsheet apps.

In java, I utlized modules File, BufferedWriter, and Connection to create a file and write to it using SQL data.
In SQL, I utilized a relational database with three tables, an employee table, a country table, and a project table.
